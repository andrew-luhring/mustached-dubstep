                        ^The hexadecimal shapes are made with two transformed divs and their designs are awesome. Every site they've worked on just <em>feels</em> cool.

                            ^Because of the particle-based physics js plugin "traer.js". Also because it's cute. Also because it's hilarious if you have your volume turned up and shake your mouse really fast.

                        Even though it's just simple css3 transforms, I'm proud of this because I didn't think it was possible. This is the kind of thing I do when I get bored and don't have plans on a saturday night...so in addition to being proud of the fact that I did something I didn't think was possible, I'm meta-proud that I enjoy what I do enough that I do it as an extracurricular activity- occasionally for the benifit of mankind.
